<h2>Scrumptious!</h2>
<h4>My youngest could live in PB&J, and if I'm being totally honest with myself, I could too. But I get burnout easily, especially when I'm trying to batch my meals for weekly prep. By Thursday, I'm so sick of PB&Js its not even funny. That's where this gem comes in. It's still the staple of peanut butter and jelly, but with a twist! This way you can still use your core ingredients, but also mix it up a little bit. Garnish with slivered almonds or chopped walnuts.</h4>
