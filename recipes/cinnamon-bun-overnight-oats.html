        <h2>Spicing up your grab-and-go breakfasts.</h2>
        <h4>I don't know about you, but I'm all about easy breakfasts. Especially sweet ones. There just something about a dash of cinnamon in the morning that really sets the pace for an excellent day. Cue this breakfast that will feel like a delicacy with every bite. If you really want to enrich it, warm it in the microwave for a few seconds, give it a stir, and drizzle a tiny bit of maple syrup on the top. Voila!</h4>
